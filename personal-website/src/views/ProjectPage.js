All of the artwork, from the grasslands to the towering trees, are designed by me. Map building algorithms generate biomes such as lakes, forests, and rocky outcropts to fully immerse the player into the land of Cobblandia. Movement is crisp as the player navigates around obstacles on the map. Make sure to avoid the Goblins, as if you are in their line of sight they will start to chase." cardVideo="/videos/cobblandia.mp4" />
